# This combination includes not a dot but rather an `empty dot`, which
# Unicode terms as a centre low stop and in no way can be normalised
# to Arabic BEH. According to Kashmiri experts this is a wrong usage
# mostly arising from faulty keyboards.

# According to Kashmiri experts, `KASHMIRI YEH` is the palatalization marker
# that is often replaced with `YEH WITH TAIL` due to inadequate input methods.
