uname_prefix: ["ARABIC", "ARABIC LETTER"]

# The <TEH MARBUTA GOAL> is specific to Arabic. By mutually agreed convention
# both in Pakistani and Indian Urdu, the <TEH MARBUTA> is replaced by a
# <HEH GOAL>. However if so desired a writer can use the <TEH MARBUTA GOAL> to
# show a word in Arabic.
# The same logic applies to <ALEF MAQSURA>. Once again, in Urdu the preferred
# form is <FARSI YEH> (U+06CC) with a <SUPERSCRIPT ALEF> (Khada Alif). In any
# case the <ALEF MAQSURA> is used with very few words such as "Musa" (Moses),
# "Isaa" (Jesus).
