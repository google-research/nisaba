r"""Grammar to convert Brahmic fixed rule romanization to ISO 15919.

By fixed rule romanization, we refer to the set of deterministic rules used
to unambiguously represent Brahmic scripts using ASCII characters, for input
purposes. ITRANS for Devanagari and Mozhi for Malayalam are examples.

The grammar defined here converts the ASCII text to ISO 15919 as per the rules
of these schemes, coded in script specific fixed.tsv. The conversion
from ISO 15919 to respective Brahmic text is available through the grammar
defined in iso.py of this library. This would complete the conversion to Brahmic
from ASCII as per the respective fixed rule specification.

Please refer to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15919 for ISO.

To try:

```sh
bazel build -c opt @org_opengrm_thrax//:rewrite-tester \
  nisaba/scripts/brahmic:fixed

cat /tmp/ml-latn-text.txt |
bazel-bin/external/org_opengrm_thrax/rewrite-tester \
  --far=bazel-bin/nisaba/scripts/brahmic/fixed.far \
  --rules=MLYM > /tmp/ml-latn-iso-text.txt
```
