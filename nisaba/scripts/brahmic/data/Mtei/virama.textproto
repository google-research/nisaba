# Apun Iyek/Khudam mark is used to mark consonant conjuncts. Meetei
# syllable structure mostly permits up to two consonants in syllable
# onset clusters. Two consonants can only be encountered in codas of
# loanwords, e.g. `beŋk` (bank).
#
# Given the consonant cluster of two consonants that needs an Apun Iyek
# (denoted K) one often encounters both `CKC` and `CCK` versions of the
# spelling. The `CCK` relates to the way people write the cluster by
# hand - Apun Iyek is drawn last - but is a wrong way to input the cluster
# on computer. Examples of `CCK` and their corrected (`CKC`) versions are
# provided below (`-` denotes syllable boundary).
