# In Unicode 13.0 the following character is referred to as "heavy tone mark".
# In linguistic literature on Manipuri this usually refers to the falling tone
# for the vowel it applies to. It is marked just after the syllable, which has
# falling tone. Please note, the authors of "Challenges in Indian Language
# Transliteration: a case of Devanagari, Bangla and Manipuri" (2nd Workshop on
# Indian Language Data: Resources and Evaluation at LREC 2014) note that
# (p. 80):
#
#   "... Though the letter ꯬ (Lum) represents the falling tone,
#    it is not presently used. It is not found in the modern
#    Manipuri language corpora."
#

# TODO: This does not play together with lonsums defined above. The
# falling tone mark cannot precede a lonsum.
# TODO: Double-check the lum iyek in the literature and in the data.
