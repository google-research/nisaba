# Dvisvara:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# From https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2002/02388-syloti-proposal.pdf:
#   The dvisvara sign can attach to consonants to form the diphthong /oi/
#   with the inherent vowel, or it can also combine with dependent or
#   independent vowels to form other diphthongs with /i/ as the second element.
