# Section II.1.5:
#   "In current usage, a visible hasanta is still not consistently used
# or considered obligatory. Thus, in both historic and modern usage,
# dead consonants and consonant clusters are regularly written with no
# indication that the inherent vowel is killed. Spellings can be
# ambiguous with respect to pronunciation, though the appropriate
# reading is generally clear from context."

# Virama, forms conjuncts.

# On alternate hasanta, please consult:
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19024-syloti-nagri-hasanta.pdf
# Note from the above document: "Examples of ALTERNATE HASANTA have not been
# found. However, it has been requested by modern Nagri users.

# A pure killer, no conjunct formed.
# TODO: Requires a fresh version of `unicodedata` package that
# matches Unicode 14.0.
