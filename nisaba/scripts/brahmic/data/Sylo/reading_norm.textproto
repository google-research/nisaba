# Dvisvara.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In the original encoding proposal in
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2002/02388-syloti-proposal.pdf
# in Section II.1.2 ("Vowel Letters and Dependent Vowel Signs") the alternative
# equivalent spellings are mentioned in the context of dvisvara use:
#   - "Note that alternate spellings of diphthongs using the independent vowel
#      /i/ are quite common".
#   - "Indeed, the dvisvara sign is only commonly used with the inherent vowel,
#      and even then the alternative use of the equivalent, independent vowel
#      /i/ is quite widespread."
# Example: "ꠀꠁꠞꠣꠝ" [airam] with <LETTER A, LETTER I, ...>.
#
# TODO: Implement.
