# This sign can appear after the inherent vowel, dependent vowel or the final
# consonant.
#   - According to https://unicode.org/L2/L2015/15332-lepcha-comments.pdf:
#     RAN is a modifier having effect on the pronunciation (length and accent) of
#     the vowels.
#   - According to https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2005/05158-n2947-lepcha.pdf:
#     RAN can only come after the inherent vowel or -a or -i, never with any of
#     the other vowels.

#   The LEPCHA SIGN RAN (U+1C36) is a modifier having effect on the
# pronunciation (length and accent) of the vowels. The sign is, thus,
# clearly associated with the vowel signs. Handwritten Lepcha
# documents reveal that the LEPCHA VOWEL SIGN OO is nothing short of a
# LEPCHA VOWEL SIGN O + RAN merged into one character when the first
# movable types were cast (Calcutta, around 1850). Likewise, the
# LEPCHA VOWEL SIGN UU - conjunct in handwriting as well - may be seen
# as a LEPCHA VOWEL SIGN U topped by a rudimentary RAN. Besides, it‘s
# noteworthy that R.K. Sprigg, the paramount expert on Lepcha
# linguistics, does not hesitate to speak of „the superscript rân
# component of the í symbol“ (1983, p. 314, para 2). This may suffice
# to stress the tight connection between vowel signs and U+1C36.
# Therefore, input of RAN immediately after the vowel signs as
# advocated by Kai (2003) and proposed by Everson et al. (2005) makes
# sense. We are not fully confident to interpret your remarks in
# appropriate way, but we have the impression that the UTC decided to
# reverse the final two elements of the syllabic structure to ease
# implementation in font production.
