# In modern times, the dominant practice is to write the dependent form of the
# au vowel using only “ൗ”, which is placed on the right side of the consonant
# it modifies; such texts are represented in Unicode using U+0D57 malayalam
# au length mark. In the past, this dependent form was written using both “െ”
# on the left side and “ൗ” on the right side; U+0D4C malayalam vowel sign au
# can be used for documents following this earlier tradition.

# When the candrakkala sign is visibly shown in Malayalam, it indicates either
# the suppression of the preceding vowel or its replacement with a neutral vowel
# sound. This sound is often called “half-u” or samvruthokaram. In traditional
# orthography it is displayed with a vowel sign -u followed by candrakkala, and
# in modern orthography it is displayed with a candrakkala alone.

# Words that formerly used dot reph on a consonant are now spelled instead with
# a chillu-rr form preceding the consonant.
#
# However, <DOT REPH, YA, VIRAMA, YA> → <RA, VIRMA, YA> is a special case.
