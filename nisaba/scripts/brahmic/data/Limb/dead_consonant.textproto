# Syllable finals.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The small letter consonants correspond to the syllable finals of native Limbu
# words. These letters are independent forms that, unlike the conjoined or
# half-letter forms of Indian scripts, may appear alone as word-final consonants
# (where Indian scripts use full consonant letters and a virama). The syllable
# finals are pronounced without a following vowel.
