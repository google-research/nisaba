# Vowel lengthening using `KEMPHRENG`:
# ------------------------------------
# Used to make a vowel slightly longer than usual. According to the online data
# it modifies the (in)dependent vowel. In one of the vowel lengthening methods,
# which is in use in Nepal, vowel length is indicated by `KEMPHRENG`, as for
# open syllables, and the syllable-final consonant appears in "small"
# form without virama (`SA-I`).
