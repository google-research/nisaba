  """Fill `raw` fields of the `item.letter`, if they are missing.

  Invisible characters like ZWJ and combining marks like FATHA cannot be
  reliably displayed in isolation or with Latin punctuation like quotes. So they
  can be omitted from a text proto, in those cases. However, when the text
  proto is parsed into Python data structure, it is useful to have the raw
  field present for every `item.letter`, for downstream processing. This routine
  fills `raw` field from the `uname` field, if missing.

  Args:
    pb: LetterLanguages proto buffer to be updated in place.
  Returns:
    None
