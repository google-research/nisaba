"""Creates FST from unweighted rules with same sigma on lhs and rhs.

Two different relationships between the rules are supported:

1. Ordered partition of unordered set of rules

This behaves as if there is no a priori order between the rules. In the
implementation, the rules are partitioned and ordered into multiple rule-sets
s.t. the following substring relationship is obeyed. The ordering of the
rule-sets are in phonological bleeding order. FSTs from each of these rule-sets
are CDRewritten and then are composed together in order.

1.1 LHS of a rule is substring of LHS of another, as in this example:
    (1) xAy -> C
    (2) A -> B
    As A is a substring of xAy, (1) should be in a rule set strictly before
    the one containing (2).

TODO: Consider additional substring relationships like:
1.2 RHS of a rule is substring of LHS of another, as in this example:
    (1) A -> B
    (2) xBy -> C
    As B is a substring of xBy, (1) should be applied strictly before (2).

1.3 (1) A -> xy
    (2) yz -> B
    As the suffix of the RHS of (1) becomes the prefix of LHS of (2),
    (1) should be applied strictly before (2).

1.4 (1) A -> yz
    (2) xy -> B
    As the prefix of the RHS of (1) becomes the suffix of LHS of (2),
    (1) should be applied strictly before (2).

Adding these relationships are prevented by the pynini timeout issue stemming
from the use of string_map(). Adding these rules can potentially increase the
number of rule-sets and that in turn could have impact the FAR file sizes.
So the FAR file size increases need to be monitored with these updates.

2. Cascading rules

Each rule is applied on the entire text individually one after another.
Obviously the textual order of the rules is important, as these are phonological
rules in feeding order. This is implemented as a sequential composition of
CDRewrites of the FSTs from each rule.
