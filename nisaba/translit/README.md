## Model-based transliteration utilities.

The libraries and tools in this directory provide higher-level transliteration
operations than the rest of Nisaba that primarily concerns itself with low-level
operations on scripts.

### Open-sourcing notes

NOTE None of the code in this directory is ready for open-source yet.

This directory contains `translit`-specific `copy.bara.sky` configuration which
is an extension of the Nisaba configuration in parent directory. This file can
be used to test the open-source export.
